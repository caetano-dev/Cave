# Notetaking app

Work in progress.

Run the backend with `DATABASE_NAME=database.db go run src/` and upload the files with the `index.html` page from the backend folder.

To-do:

- Add the filepath to the database. (The frontend sends requests to the backend based on the current filename, present in the frontend) or we can search in the DB by ID.
- Allow user to edit the file and save to the server it with CTRL+S

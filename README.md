# Notetaking app

work in progress.

Run the backend with ``````DATABASE_NAME=database.db go run src/.`````` and upload the files with the index.html page from the backend folder.

To-do:

- Add the filepath to the database. (The frontend sends requests to the backend based on the current filename, present in the frontend) or we can search in the DB by ID.
- Finish the frontend
